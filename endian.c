/*
This code will contain a single function (and the include directive to your header
file) to perform the endian swap operation of the 32-bit input argument passed to
this function. Endianness refers to how the bytes are stored in memory. In a 32-
bit word, there are 4 bytes â€“ B0, B1, B2, and B3. Let us assume that B0 refers to
the least significant byte and B3 the most significant byte.
The function will swap (exchange) bytes B0 and B3, as well as bytes B1 and B2.
