/*
This is the code file with the main() function that will do the following: 
(1) display the menu, 
(2) read in the user’s response for the menu selection, 
(3) prompt for and read an integer operand between 1 and 4294967295, inclusively,
(4) if the “Rotate Right” operation is selected, then prompt for a second integer
between 0 and 31 (inclusively) to obtain the rotate amount, and finally, based on
the menu selection, 
(5) call the appropriate function call for the specified operation, passing the 
integer operand(s) as parameter(s) to the function. This functionality will be
contained in a loop that will continue to iterate until the user selects the option
to end the program. If the user enters a valid outside of the 1 – 5 range, you will
print a meaningful error message and re-display the menu. Additionally, you will
continue to prompt for and read in the integer operand until the user enters an
appropriate value (no error message is needed here).
